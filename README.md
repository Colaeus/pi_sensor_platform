Pi sensor platform

This is a place to keep the code (often borrowed with pride from those who came before) to get my vision
of a basic sensor platform running on the Pi.

In the end it will include the code, configuration on the Pi and .stl files for cases.

Work in progress, construction zone, hard hats required.
